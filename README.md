# Mapping-individual-differences-in-cortical-architecture-using-multi-view-representation-learning


============

This is an mplementation of the multi-view representation learning and trace regression models for mapping individual differences using multimdodal fMRI data as described in our paper:
 
A. Sellami et al. [Mapping-individual-differences-in-cortical-architecture-using-multi-view-representation-learning](https://hal-univ-tln.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02520673/), IJCNN conference (2020)

We proposed a multimodal deep autoencoder (MDAE) framework that allows combining the activation- and connectivity-based fMRI protocols to identify markers of individual differences. 
MAEs are trainable neural network models for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction.
